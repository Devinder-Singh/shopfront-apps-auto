# QA System

This repo serves to host a shared Node.js / JS Qa system for integrated testing across the various verticles.


### Features:

- customised nightwatch distro

- custom Takealot chrome plugin for e2e automation script generation




### Getting started




##### Nightwatch





##### Extension

> WIP - until the react version is done, basic tryout can be done by installing the extension from ./extension/build/orig

> once intial work is done, extension will be compiled and built in react. The plugin was orignally adapted from a native version found on github, and will hopefully grow into a toolset manager for the QA team here-on. React version is stil far from ready for basic tasks.
